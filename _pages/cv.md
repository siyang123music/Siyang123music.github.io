# Profile

I am studying at the Royal College of Music. I  am a music student who attended the Xi'an Conservatory of Music as an undergraduate and the University of Southampton as a postgraduate. My chosen major is music education. 

Recently, I have been researching the adaptation of musicians, especially collaborative pianists, in different acoustic venues and applying interventions using techniques from Meyer Sound and Steinway & Son's spiro. If you are interested in this promising field, please reach out and talk about it with me.
